## Description

I use NestJS and MongoDB database to perform the test.

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to complete task 2 yet because I haven't had much exposure to XML, I probably need more time for task 2. I haven't been able to finish it yet.

I assumed that the database had customer reservation data to do task 3, which is payment with VietcomBank.

## Running with docker

Requires a computer with Docker installed.

```bash
# run command
$ docker compose up
