## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

Because I haven't had much exposure to XML, I probably need more time for task 2. I haven't been able to finish it yet.

I assumed that the database had customer reservation data to do task 3, which is payment with VietComBank.

```bash
# run command
